A Brief History of the Seminar's Study
--------------------------------------

Recently, we have had been working on essays drawn from Rand's nonfiction
anthologies (<a title="For the New Intellectual: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand"
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451163087"
target="_blank">1</a>,<a title="Philosophy: Who Needs It"
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451138937"
target="_blank">2</a>,<a title="The Virtue of Selfishness"
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451163931"
target="_blank">3</a>,<a title="Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal"
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451147952"
target="_blank">4</a>,<a title="The Romantic Manifesto"
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451149165"
target="_blank">5</a>,<a title="The Return of the Primitive: The Anti-Industrial
Revolution"
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0452011841"
target="_blank">6</a>,<a title="The Voice of Reason: Essays in Objectivist
Thought"
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0452010462"
target="_blank">7</a>), Robert Mayhew's collections of essays on Rand's
novels (<a title="Essays on Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged"
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0739127802"
target="_blank">1</a>,<a title="Essays on Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead"
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0739115782"
target="_blank">2</a>,<a title="Essays on Ayn Rand's Anthem"
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0739110314"
target="_blank">3</a>,<a title="Essays on Ayn Rand's We the Living"
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0739106988"
target="_blank">4</a>), and articles published in <em><a title="The Objective
Standard" href="http://theobjectivestandard.com/">The Objective
Standard</a></em> journal. (Note that a good amount of this material is also
available free online.)

Before that we worked through Ayn Rand's monograph on concept formation,
<em><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0452010306"
target="_blank">Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology</a></em>, Expanded
Second Edition. You can access the 37 sessions as podcasts in the archives!

Before that we enjoyed a tour of Dr. Leonard Peikoff's book, <em><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0452011175">The
Ominous Parallels</a></em>. The parallels were indeed striking given the
acceleration toward statism that political events are showing. You can access
the 15 sessions as podcasts in the archives!

Before that, we worked through Dr. Leonard Peikoff's seminal
summary, <em><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0452011019"
target="_blank">Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand</a></em> in 53 detailed
sessions which you can access as podcasts in the archives.

And finally, the first book we studied was Dr. Tara Smith's book, <em><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521705460"
target="_blank">Ayn Rand's Normative Ethics: The Virtuous Egoist</a></em>
&mdash; you can access the 20 sessions as podcasts in the archives, above.
