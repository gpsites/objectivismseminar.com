Invitation to The Seminar
=========================

Truly living well calls for engaging fundamental philosophical ideas and
integrating their use into our everyday lives, our everyday actions, our way of
being — into our souls. Unfortunately, it is all too easy to get busy with
the urgent things around us, and we can drift, distracted and disintegrated. For
those of us who want an ongoing practice in such engagement (and those who want
to explore the need for that in the first place), we have created The Objectivism
Seminar.

The Objectivism Seminar is a weekly online conference call to systematically
study the philosophy of Ayn Rand via the works of prominent Rand scholars. These
moderated, one-hour sessions will be recorded and podcast to allow review,
catch-up, and even disconnected participation. The idea is to give people new
and experienced alike a forum to digest key Objectivist works involving
the entire system, further clarifying, integrating, and grounding our grasp of
the ideas.

Because this is an ongoing seminar, we will have incentive to keep up with a
steady schedule of study and stay equipped to consider fresh angles,
concretizations, challenges, and applications from other participants. And
because life is so full for many of us, we keep the reading load light and the
method of participation unobtrusive. The plan is to spend about as much time
discussing the ideas as reading about them. Study like this is productive for
both experienced scholars and those new to Rand's ideas: several of us have already read these
books, some several times, and we would expect to get at least as much out of
this as someone going through them for the first time.
