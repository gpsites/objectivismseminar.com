Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

What is The Objectivism Seminar?
-----------------------------------
The Objectivism Seminar is a weekly online conference call to systematically
work through the philosophy of Ayn Rand via the works of prominent Rand scholars.
These moderated one-hour sessions will be recorded and podcast to allow review,
catch-up, and even disconnected participation.

How much does it cost?
-------------------------
Nothing! (Well, there's your time, and the cost of whatever we're reading. :^)

Do I have to be an Objectivist to participate?
-------------------------------------------------
Nope! The purpose of the seminar is to give people a means to critically engage
Objectivism and improve their understanding of the philosophy. Anybody who is
polite and honest in this effort is welcome; anybody who disrupts others in that
endeavor is not. (The process of examining ideas can be challenging enough that
we certainly don't need to have someone being rude or beating us up
psychologically while we do it!)

What are the books we'll be working through?
-----------------------------------------------
Please see our <a title="history page" href="/history">history page</a> to
see what we've worked through and are currently working on.

How much material will we cover per week? (How heavy is the work load?)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
We all have busy lives, so this is designed to be a slow-and-steady project.
I hope we can work through a chapter every two weeks, but depending on the
material and peoples' needs and interests, that will vary. In raw numbers, the
expected load will be an average of 15 pages of reading and one hour of
discussion per week.

When, where, and how do we meet?
-----------------------------------
Monday evenings 8:00-10:00ish <a title="Mountain time zone"
href="http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/time-zone/usa/mountain-time/"
target="_blank">Mountain</a>, we'll meet in an online conference call so people
from anywhere can join in. For those who miss a meeting (and those who want to
join in halfway through a book), we'll have podcast recordings of the sessions
available. There are also email lists for discussion, announcements, and
behind-the-scenes planning.

What tools will I need?
--------------------------
The Objectivism Seminar is conducted using FreeConferenceCall.com (<a
href="http://www.freeconferencecall.com/wall/objectivismseminar" target="_blank">www.FreeConferenceCall.com/wall/objectivismseminar</a>). This
allows us to hold a large conference call for free, with each person connecting
by phone, VoIP, Skype, or using FreeConferenceCall's free VoIP-based web application -- 
and it gives us the ability to record and podcast our sessions for future
reference and catching up. There's an instant-messaging facility as
well, for typing administrivia and incidental side-comments to each other during
the sessions. 

What's the fine print?
-------------------------
Here are the details I could think of to keep The Objectivism Seminar sailing
as smoothly as possible; other wrinkles will be addressed as they arise.

* GOVERNANCE: To put it simply, this is not a democracy. The Objectivism Seminar 
is a benevolent dictatorship, but I (Greg) will work for openness and consensus 
and eagerly entertain suggestions about how to make this a more fun and productive 
adventure for all, and when there are difficulties I will do my best to be patient 
and fair to help us get things straightened out. 
* RECORDINGS: Please keep in mind that any session recordings will belong to me 
and may not be transferred or distributed without my explicit permission.
